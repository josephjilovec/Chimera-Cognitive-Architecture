;; test-knowledge.lisp: Unit and integration tests for the knowledge base in backend/lisp/reasoning/knowledge-base.lisp
;; using FiveAM for the Chimera Cognitive Architecture. Tests concept retrieval, updates, and error handling
;; (e.g., (isa dog mammal)). Mocks interactions with the Julia layer to isolate tests. Aims for â‰¥90% test coverage
;; of knowledge-base.lisp functions. Includes detailed comments explaining test scenarios. Designed for SBCL.
