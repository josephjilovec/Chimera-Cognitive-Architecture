Chimera Cognitive Architecture

Overview

The Chimera Cognitive Architecture is an open-source framework for hybrid AI systems, integrating symbolic reasoning, neural network learning, and quantum-enhanced computation. It combines the strengths of:

Symbolic Reasoning: Implemented in Common Lisp for high-level logic, planning, and metaprogramming (see backend/lisp/).
Neural Networks: Leveraged via Julia with Flux.jl for dynamic neural architecture generation (see backend/julia/neural/).
Quantum Computation: Enabled by Julia with Yao.jl for quantum circuit design and optimization (see backend/julia/quantum/).
GPU Acceleration: Supported through CUDA for high-performance parallel processing (see backend/julia/cuda/).

Chimera aims to create a self-evolving system capable of generating its own code, neural architectures, and quantum circuits. It is designed for advanced researchers and developers in AI, quantum computing, and high-performance computing, such as quantum cloud teams and xAI researchers. For detailed system design, refer to docs/architecture.md.

Usage Examples
Defining a Symbolic Concept (Common Lisp)
Define concepts for symbolic reasoning in the knowledge base:
(defconcept (isa dog mammal)
  :attributes ((has-part tail) (has-property barks)))

See backend/lisp/reasoning/ for more details.
Training a Neural Network (Julia)
Generate and train a neural network for image classification:
using Flux
model = Chain(Dense(784, 128, relu), Dense(128, 10, softmax))
# Train model with data
# See backend/julia/neural/ for implementation

Refer to backend/julia/neural/ for neural network generation.
Executing a Quantum Circuit (Julia)
Define and run a quantum circuit for optimization:
using Yao
circuit = chain(4, put(1 => H), put(2 => X), measure(4))
# Execute on quantum backend
# See backend/julia/quantum/ for details

See backend/julia/quantum/ for quantum circuit examples.
For complete API and function documentation, refer to docs/api.md.
