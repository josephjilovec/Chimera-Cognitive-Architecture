Chimera Cognitive Architecture
The Chimera Cognitive Architecture is an open-source framework designed to integrate symbolic reasoning, parallel computation, and quantum modeling to solve complex cognitive tasks. By combining a Lisp-based symbolic reasoning engine, a Julia-based parallel computation engine with CUDA acceleration, and a quantum modeling engine using Yao.jl, Chimera enables hybrid intelligence workflows that are modular, scalable, and suitable for advanced technical audiences, such as quantum cloud teams and AI researchers. This document outlines the architecture's components, their interactions, and data flow, referencing key implementation files and using Mermaid diagrams for clarity.
Overview
Chimera is structured to orchestrate cognitive tasks through three primary engines:

Symbolic Reasoning Engine (Lisp): Handles high-level planning, knowledge representation, and inference using Common Lisp for robust symbolic processing.
Parallel Computation Engine (Julia with CUDA): Executes computationally intensive neural network tasks with GPU acceleration, leveraging Flux.jl and CUDA.jl for performance.
Quantum Modeling Engine (Julia with Yao.jl): Simulates and executes quantum circuits for optimization and modeling tasks, using Yao.jl for quantum computations.

These engines communicate via JSON over TCP sockets, ensuring modularity and interoperability. The architecture supports hybrid workflows, cloud deployment, and open-source contribution, aligning with modern AI research demands.
System Components
1. Symbolic Reasoning Engine (Lisp)
The symbolic reasoning engine, implemented in Common Lisp (SBCL), is responsible for knowledge representation, inference, and task planning. It processes symbolic instructions, decomposes complex problems into sub-tasks, and delegates computations to the Julia layer.

Key Files:

backend/lisp/reasoning/knowledge-base.lisp: Manages the knowledge base, storing concepts (e.g., (isa dog mammal)) and predicates (e.g., has-part, has-property). Provides functions like add-concept, query-knowledge-base, and update-concept.
backend/lisp/reasoning/inference.lisp: Implements logical inference to derive new relationships (e.g., (isa dog animal) from (isa dog mammal) and (isa mammal animal)).
backend/lisp/reasoning/macros.lisp: Defines macros (e.g., defconcept-fn, defrule) to simplify concept and rule definition.
backend/lisp/planner.lisp: Decomposes problems (e.g., classification, quantum-optimization) into sub-tasks and generates JSON instructions for the Julia layer via send-to-julia.


Functionality:

Knowledge representation using hash tables for concepts and predicates.
Inference rules for transitive relationships (e.g., isa hierarchies).
Task planning with problem decomposition and instruction generation.
Secure communication with the Julia layer using JSON over TCP sockets.



2. Parallel Computation Engine (Julia with CUDA)
The parallel computation engine, implemented in Julia (1.10.0), handles neural network computations with Flux.jl (0.14.0) and GPU acceleration via CUDA.jl (5.4.0). It processes instructions from the Lisp layer, executes computations, and returns results.

Key Files:

backend/julia/main.jl: Entry point for the Julia layer, dispatching tasks to neural, CUDA, or quantum modules using JSON parsing and TCP sockets.
backend/julia/neural/network.jl: Generates neural network architectures (e.g., dense layers with ReLU, softmax) from symbolic instructions.
backend/julia/neural/training.jl: Trains neural networks with specified parameters, supporting GPU/CPU execution.
backend/julia/cuda/gpu_utils.jl: Manages GPU resources, moving computations to GPU with CPU fallback and optimizing memory usage.


Functionality:

Neural network generation and training for tasks like classification.
GPU-accelerated computations with memory optimization (e.g., CUDA.reclaim()).
Robust error handling for invalid instructions or hardware unavailability.
JSON-based communication with the Lisp layer for task results.



3. Quantum Modeling Engine (Julia with Yao.jl)
The quantum modeling engine, also implemented in Julia, uses Yao.jl (0.8.0) to generate and execute quantum circuits for optimization and modeling tasks. It supports both simulation and potential hardware execution.

Key Files:

backend/julia/quantum/circuit.jl: Generates quantum circuits from symbolic instructions (e.g., Hadamard, CNOT gates).
backend/julia/quantum/execution.jl: Executes circuits on a Yao.jl simulator or quantum hardware (via API key), returning measurement results.


Functionality:

Circuit construction with gates like H, CNOT, and Z.
Simulation of quantum circuits with configurable shot counts.
Placeholder for hardware execution using cloud quantum services.
Error handling for invalid circuit specifications or backend unavailability.

Data Flow Explanation

Task Initiation: A user provides a symbolic task (e.g., (neural-network :layers ((dense 784 128 :relu)))) to planner.lisp.
Problem Decomposition: planner.lisp uses decompose-problem to break the task into sub-tasks (e.g., neural network creation, training), consulting knowledge-base.lisp and inference.lisp for relevant concepts and relationships.
Instruction Generation: generate-instructions in planner.lisp converts sub-tasks into JSON instructions (e.g., {"module": "Flux", "code": "..."}).
Socket Communication: send-to-julia sends JSON instructions to main.jl over TCP sockets.
Task Dispatching: main.jl parses JSON and routes tasks to the appropriate module:
Neural tasks to network.jl and training.jl for network creation and training.
GPU tasks to gpu_utils.jl for accelerated computation.
Quantum tasks to circuit.jl and execution.jl for circuit generation and execution.


Result Return: Each module returns JSON results (e.g., {"status": "success", "results": {...}}) to main.jl, which sends them back to planner.lisp via sockets.
Output Formatting: planner.lisp processes results and formats them for the user.

Error Handling and Robustness

Lisp Layer:

Custom conditions (knowledge-base-error, inference-error, invalid-input-error) handle invalid inputs, unknown concepts, and socket errors.
Input sanitization (e.g., sanitize-concept) prevents injection attacks.
Tests in tests/lisp/test-knowledge.lisp and test-planner.lisp ensure ≥90% coverage.


Julia Layer:

Custom exceptions (NeuralNetworkError, TrainingError, QuantumCircuitError, QuantumExecutionError, GPUError) handle invalid specifications, hardware issues, and memory constraints.
Constraints like MAX_LAYERS, MAX_QUBITS, and MAX_MEMORY_USAGE prevent resource abuse.
Tests in tests/julia/test-neural.jl and test-quantum.jl ensure ≥90% coverage.



Scalability and Deployment

Modularity: Each component (Lisp, neural, CUDA, quantum) is isolated in its own module, supporting easy extension or replacement.
Cloud Deployment: The architecture supports containerization (deploy/Dockerfile) and Kubernetes deployment (deploy/kubernetes.yml) for cloud scalability.
CI/CD: GitHub Actions workflows in .github/workflows/ci.yml run tests (pytest, cargo test, npm test) and deploy to AWS, ensuring reliability.
Open-Source Contribution: The repository structure (backend/, tests/, docs/) and MIT license encourage community contributions.

Future Enhancements

Integrate real quantum hardware backends (e.g., IBM Quantum, AWS Braket) in execution.jl.
Expand inference rules in inference.lisp for more complex reasoning.
Optimize GPU memory management in gpu_utils.jl for larger neural networks.
Add a frontend dashboard (frontend/src/App.js) for visualizing task execution.
